# pwm
======

**pwm** is a fork of the dwm codebase that I started to suit my own needs of having a minimalist userspace while also being aimed at graphic arts afficionados such as myself. I modeled this after my own i3 setup, so several tabs are assigned different applications:

1. web
2. mail
3. term
4. gimp
5. inkscape
6. blender
7. write
8. misc

If you're not a creative person you might not get much out of this, otherwise this one is for you.
