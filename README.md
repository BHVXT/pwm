# pwm
======

**pwm** is a fork of the dwm codebase that I started to suit my own needs of having a minimalist userspace while also being aimed at graphic arts afficionados such as myself. I modeled this after my own i3 setup, so several tabs are assigned different applications:

1. web
2. mail
3. term
4. gfx
5. etc

**web** is mainly assigned to Chromium at the moment but is mainly for general web browsing.
**mail** is intended for mutt and general email.
**term** is for the terminal, which can be for anything; groff, latex, ranger/vimfm, you name it
**gfx** is a dedicated tab for Gimp, Blender, and Inkscape
**etc** is for... well, anything else

If you're not a creative person you might not get much out of this, otherwise this one is for you.
